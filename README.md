# Argy Parsey Darsey Larsey

This is a playground for working with argp. The code was initially taken from an example then horribly hacked at until it did what I wanted it to, namely take an unspecified number of arguments and do what I want with them using strcmp()

## Y tho?

As a way of learning fun stuff, I want to make a sort of command line assitant in c that I can use as a calculator, converter and whatever else.

## Usage

Currently the only thing it does is spit back values at you. There's still a lot of stuff in there from when it needed regular arguments which I removed. 

Right now you can pass in values using -a, -b and -c

- If you pass a "+" in to -a it'll pass -b and -c to a function that adds them together


That's it for now.
